The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return *the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police***.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

### 解法

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

        int[] left = dp(node.left);
        int[] right = dp(node.right);
        
        int do_rob = node.val + left[0] + right[0];
        int do_not_rob = Math.max(left[0],left[1]) + Math.max(right[0],right[1]);
        
        return new int[]{do_not_rob,do_rob};
    }
