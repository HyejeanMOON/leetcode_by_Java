Hard,

Hash Table, String, Sliding Window.

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

- For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef"`, `"abefcd"`, `"cdabef"`, `"cdefab"`, `"efabcd"`, and `"efcdab"` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef"` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return *the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in* `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
We return an empty array.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
Output: [6,9,12]
Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

### 解法

因为每个word的长度是一样的，所以我们可以用下面特别的方法。

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        Map<String,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int wordSize = words[0].length();
        int size = wordSize*words.length;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if(size>s.length()) return res;
        
        
        for(String w: words){
            map.put(w, map.getOrDefault(w,0)+1);
        }   
        
        for(int i=0; i<s.length()-size+1; i++){
            int left = i;
            int right = left+wordSize;
            Map<String,Integer> currentMap = new HashMap<>();
            
            while(right-i<=size){
                String str = s.substring(left,right);
                int times = map.getOrDefault(str,0);
                if(times==0) break;
                int currentTimes = currentMap.getOrDefault(str,0);
                currentTimes++;
                currentMap.put(str,currentTimes);
                if(times<currentTimes) break;
                left = right;
                right += wordSize;
            }
            
            if(right-i-wordSize==size) {
                res.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```
